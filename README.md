# Scam Call Detection System

This project aims to develop a **Scam Call Detection System** using advanced machine learning techniques. The system will be able to identify scam calls based on call transcripts and notify the user in real-time.

## Features

- **Real-Time Scam Detection**: The system detects scam calls based on transcripts from calls.
- **Multi-Scam Type Detection**: It identifies different types of scams, including tech support, financial, and phishing scams.
- **User Notification**: Alerts the user if a scam is detected during a call.
- **AI-Based Classification**: Utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning models like BERT to classify call types.
- **Scalable**: The system can be scaled to handle thousands of calls with real-time processing.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: The main script that runs the application and processes the data.
- `scam_model.py`: The model training and evaluation script for scam detection.
- `data/`: Contains the datasets used for training the model.
